This is the very latest version of the README file for the basic Introduction To GPU Programming Course.

NOTE the `.devcontainer` configuration is present to verify the runtime of the code; development should be done with a newer version of CUDA (as the `nsight` plugin doesn't support the targeted cuda version)
